# Short introduction to myself

Hey, I'm Mika and I've worked in QA as a volunteer for a little over 2 years. In this time I have reported ~70 tickets for Fleetyard Studios, and ~200 for Messy Desk Interactive. This does not count interactions (comments, updating status, ...), since those difficult to track both on mantis and GitLab. I expect there to be around 1000 interactions for Fleetyard and Messy Desk combined, not counting any ticket changes that happened because of changes to the ticket process, where I was often the person to update the whole bug tracker to adhere to these changes for Fleetyard.
