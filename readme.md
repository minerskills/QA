# Short introduction to myself
Hey!

As a highly motivated person with a strong passion for gaming and quality assurance. With experience as both a QA tester and QA lead at Messy Desk Interactive and Fleetyard Studios, I have developed a range of skills and expertise that I believe are extremely valuable in this career path.

As a QA tester and QA lead, I have honed my attention to detail and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to communicate effectively with team members and the general public. In addition to that I have a strong foundation in Java thanks to my computer science classes in school, and am also familiar with Unreal Engine 4 and 5, having explored a number of the features and capabilities offered by the software.

In my work at Messy Desk Interactive, I had the opportunity to contribute to The Orville: Interactive Fan Experience as a QA Tester, and at Fleetyard Studios, I worked on Starship Simulator, testing the game and administrating the bug tracker. Both projects have allowed me to greatly expand my skills and knowledge, especially in regards to communication.

I am always eager to take on new challenges and learn as much as possible. I look forward to continuing to grow and develop in my career and make a meaningful impact in the gaming industry.


## Example 1

While testing a development build, I noticed a significant decrease in FPS when moving my character in the outer areas of the ship (311FPS -> 16FPS). Using my knowledge of Unreal Engine's debug tools, I was able to narrow the problem down to the function that was causing the issue.

This allowed the developers to fix the issue within a few minutes.
