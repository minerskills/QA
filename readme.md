# Short introduction to myself
Hey!

As a highly motivated person with a strong passion for gaming and quality assurance. With experience as both a QA tester and QA lead at Messy Desk Interactive and Fleetyard Studios, I have developed a range of skills and expertise that I believe are extremely valuable in this career path.

As a QA tester and QA lead, I have honed my attention to detail and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to communicate effectively with team members and the general public. In addition to that I have a strong foundation in Java thanks to my computer science classes in school, and am also familiar with Unreal Engine 4 and 5, having explored a number of the features and capabilities offered by the software.

In my work at Messy Desk Interactive, I had the opportunity to contribute to The Orville: Interactive Fan Experience as a QA Tester, and at Fleetyard Studios, I worked on Starship Simulator, testing the game and administrating the bug tracker. Both projects have allowed me to greatly expand my skills and knowledge, especially in regards to communication.

I am always eager to take on new challenges and learn as much as possible. I look forward to continuing to grow and develop in my career and make a meaningful impact in the gaming industry.

# Examples of my work


## Example 1

While testing a development build, I noticed a significant decrease in FPS when moving my character in the outer areas of the ship (311FPS -> 16FPS). Using my knowledge of Unreal Engine's debug tools, I was able to narrow the problem down to the function that was causing the issue.

This allowed the developers to fix the issue within a few minutes.

## Example 2

One of the challenges we faced as a QA team was the inability to mass move tickets from the "confirmed" status to "assigned" once developers started working on another system. To address this issue, I collaborated with the lead developer to utilize the tags feature of the Mantis bug tracker.

First, we identified the systems that required their own tags and added them to Mantis. I also added descriptions of potential bugs for each system, such as:

    Helm & Flight systems:
        Ship won't respond to helm input.
        Location in space is different to what is expected.
        Ship movement doesn't properly replicate over the network.

Next, I went through every active ticket on the tracker and added the correct tags. This allowed us to more easily track and assign tickets to the appropriate developers. In addition to this, I added a section to the QA process document to document the revised procedure.

Overall, this reform of the bug tracker significantly improved our ability to track and assign tickets, resulting in more efficient and effective quality assurance processes. It also allowed us to prioritise some systems over others.
