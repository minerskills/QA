# Short introduction to myself

As one of the QA Leads at Fleetyard Studios, I have played a key role in ensuring the quality and playability of our games. In my 2.5 years with the project, I have identified and reported over 80 issues, and have had over 1000 interactions with our bug tracking system. In addition to my work on Fleetyard's projects, I have also contributed to the testing efforts of Messy Desk Interactive as a QA Tester, where I identified and reported around 200 issues.

Some specific examples of my work as a QA Lead include:


- Developing and implementing a new process for tracking and prioritizing issues in our bug tracker. This process helped to improve the efficiency of our testing efforts and allowed us to more effectively address the most critical issues.
- Leading the testing efforts for the first ever demo and playtest of Starship Simulator, in preparation for the projects Kickstarter.

Overall, my track record as a QA Lead demonstrates my ability to identify and report on issues, work effectively with development teams, and develop and implement effective processes for testing and tracking issues."


## Bug Example 1

In a development build we ran into an issue which decreased FPS significantly when moving your character in the outer areas of the ship (311FPS -> 16FPS). Using Unreal Engines debug tools, I was able to narrow the problem down to the function that was causing the problem.

Which then allowed the Developers to fix the issue within a few minutes.
